   Clone the repository and install the dependencies using:

2. 📂 Data Preparation

   Due to the large size of datasets required for job trend and course analysis(we had merged more than 3-4 datasets), we recommend downloading publicly available 
   datasets from **Kaggle**:
   some are below,
   - 📌 [Job Postings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) – Contains job listings with titles, descriptions, required skills, 
   and locations.
   - 📌 [Online Courses Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emrebayirr/udemy-course-dataset-categories-ratings-and-trends) – Includes information about online 
   courses such as title, skills taught, ratings, number of subscribers, and more.

3. ### ▶️ Run the App

   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py and it goes to http://localhost:5000
